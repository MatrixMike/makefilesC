# makefilesC
Demo of makefile architecture
Needs some explanation of possibilities:
sudo make install
where exec ends up

check compile messages 

recall that we can pass args : make --makefile=Makefile3   or --file=<input makefile>

also make --help
some early experiments included building app from multiple files e.g. main.c and 2.c and 3.c
also note that geany will help with makefiles, edit and exec ...
